Hi Dave and Graders!

This repository has the files as well as my code for the project. BIG NOTE, github won't let me upload data files greater than 100MB. I was able
to get around most of it by compressing the files. There is one data files that needs to be downloaded from the source.

This repository contains:

project_code.ipynb: this is a jupyter notebook file containing all my code. This contains 617 lines of code.

County_CVAP.csv.zip: this is a zip file for the county citizen voter age population data. Git won't let me upload files over 100mb so this needs to be unzipped and 
  named County_CVAP.csv. From https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html

Poverty.csv: this is a zip file containing poverty data. Source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/

county_county.tsv.zip: this is the facebook SCI data that pairs counties and tallies facebook connections between them. Again, it is a zip file 
  that needs to be unzipped and renamed to county_county.tsv before it can be run. Source: https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/docs/methodology-social-connectedness-index


demographic.csv.zip: this contains demographic data on race and gender. This needs to be unzipped and renamed demographic.csv. 
  From https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html

education.csv: this contains education data. Source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/

election.csv: this contains data on 2020 presidential election.
  Source: https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-20/blob/f9b5f335ad1c66a7eba681539db49eec0c22787b/2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv

unemployment.csv: this contains unemployment data as well as income level. Source: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/

ADDITIONAL:
Please go to https://www.nber.org/research/data/county-distance-database and download the 2010 county distance csv file and name it countydistancemiles.csv. 
I could not upload this file on github, as even compressed, it was too large.
